constants.py

This module defines various physical and mathematical constants
required for amateur radio satellite tracking. These constants are used
throughout the codebase to convert units, perform coordinate
transformations, and compute orbital parameters using the Keplerian
model.

Constants include:
- Gravitational parameters
- Earth parameters (radius, flattening factors)
- Conversion factors (between degrees and radians, days to seconds)
- The Earth rotation rate (omega_earth)
- A preset number of time points for propagation, and
  initial observer latitude for computations.

All constants are defined using SI units unless otherwise noted.
